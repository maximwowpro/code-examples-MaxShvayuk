# Candle flashing
This is **BARE-METAL-AVR** project, **without** using any Arduino functions or libraries.
The LED, connected to ATMEGA328p MCU emulates the candle's flashing, using PWM and algorithm, described in [this article](https://habr.com/post/206556/).

To flash this project to your ATMega2560 MCU, just run `make all` from this folder.

#### This is how candle flashing looks like:

In reality it looks better than video.
